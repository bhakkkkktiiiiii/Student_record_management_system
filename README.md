# Student_record_management_system
I have developed a digital Student record management system using c++
This C++ program is designed to address the need for an efficient system to manage student records in educational institutions. It provides a menu-driven interface for entering, displaying, searching, updating, and deleting student records. The program utilizes object-oriented programming principles with classes representing both a generic Person and a specialized Student, inheriting from the Person class. Student data is stored in a text file for persistence.
